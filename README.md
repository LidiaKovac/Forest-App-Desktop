# FOREST APP CLONE 🌲
This is not the official Forest App repository, just a clone of  <a href='https://www.forestapp.cc'>this</a> app. I made this for fun and educational purposes of studying timers and timeouts! 

## 🌲 FEATURES: 
This features the very basics of the original app: 
- Set a timer to plant a tree.
- If you leave before the tree has grown, it will die. 
- You can give up and terminate your timer in advance. 
- If you leave the tab or cover the browser with another window, you have 5 seconds to come back. 

### 🐛PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS YOU MIGHT HAVE FOUND IN MY APP, I WILL BE VERY HAPPY TO FIX THEM!
